# Get started with the Azure Service Bus connector

Connect to Azure Service Bus to send and receive messages. You can perform actions such as send to queue, send to topic, receive from queue, receive from subscription, etc.

To use [any connector](./apis-list.md), you first need to create a Logic app. You can get started by [creating a Logic app now](../app-service-logic/app-service-logic-create-a-logic-app.md).

## Connect to Azure Service Bus

Before your Logic app can access any service, you first need to create a *connection* to the service. A [connection](./connectors-overview.md) provides connectivity between a Logic app and another service.  

### Create a connection to Azure Service Bus

>[AZURE.INCLUDE [Steps to create a connection to Azure Service Bus](../../includes/connectors-create-api-servicebus.md)]

## Use a Azure Service Bus trigger

A trigger is an event that can be used to start the workflow defined in a Logic app. [Learn more about triggers](../app-service-logic/app-service-logic-what-are-logic-apps.md#logic-app-concepts).  

[Learn more about the available Azure Service Bus triggers](../connectors-create-api-servicebus.md#azure-service-bus-triggers)  

## Use a Azure Service Bus action

An action is an operation carried out by the workflow defined in a Logic app. [Learn more about actions](../app-service-logic/app-service-logic-what-are-logic-apps.md#logic-app-concepts).

# Get started with the HTTP + Swagger action

With the HTTP + Swagger action, you can create a first-class connector to any REST endpoint through a [Swagger document](https://swagger.io).

- Extend a logic app to call any REST endpoint with a first-class designer experience

To get started using the HTTP + Swagger action in a logic app, see [create a logic app](../app-service-logic/app-service-logic-create-a-logic-app.md).

## Use HTTP + Swagger as a trigger or an action

The HTTP + Swagger trigger and action functions the same as the [HTTP action](connectors-native-http.md) but provides a better design experience by showing the shape of the API and outputs in the designer from the [swagger metadata](https://swagger.io).  In addition, you can use HTTP + Swagger as a trigger, and if you want to implement a polling trigger should follow the polling patter [described in this document](../app-service-logic/app-service-logic-create-api-app.md#polling-triggers).
	
[Learn more about Logic App triggers and actions.](connectors-overview.md)

Here's an example of using the HTTP + Swagger operation as an action in a workflow.

1. Select the **New Step** button
1. Choose **Add an action**
1. In the action search box, type "swagger" to list the HTTP + Swagger action

	![Select HTTP + Swagger action](./media/connectors-native-http-swagger/using-action-1.png)

1. Enter in the URL for a swagger document
	- The URL must be an HTTPS endpoint and have CORS enabled to work from the designer. If the swagger document does not meet this you can use [Azure storage with CORS enabled](#hosting-swagger-from-storage) to store the document.
1. Click next to read and render from the swagger document
1. Add in any parameters required for the HTTP call

	![Complete HTTP action](./media/connectors-native-http-swagger/using-action-2.png)

1. Click save at the top left corner of the toolbar, and your logic app will both save and publish (activate)

### Hosting Swagger from Storage

You may wish to reference a swagger document which is either not hosted, or does not meet the security and cross-origin requirements needed to use in the designer.  As a workaround, you can store the swagger document in Azure storage and enable CORS to reference the document.  Here are the steps to create, configure, and store swagger in Azure storage:

1. [Create an Azure storage account with blob storage](../storage/storage-create-storage-account.md) -- set permissions to "Public Access"
1. Enable CORS on the Blob 
	- You can use [this PowerShell script](https://github.com/logicappsio/EnableCORSAzureBlob/blob/master/EnableCORSAzureBlob.ps1) to configure that setting automatically.
1. Upload the swagger file into the Azure Blob
	- You can do this from the [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com) or from a tool like [Azure Storage Explorer](http://storageexplorer.com/)
1. Reference an HTTPS link to the document in Azure Blob (follows the format `https://*storageAccountName*.blob.core.windows.net/*container*/*filename*`)

## Technical details

Below are the details for the triggers and actions this connector supports.

|Trigger|Description|
|---|---|
|HTTP + Swagger|Make an HTTP call and return the response content|

## HTTP + Swagger actions

An action is an operation carried out by the workflow defined in a Logic app. [Learn more about actions.](connectors-overview.md) The HTTP + Swagger connector has 1 possible action. 

|Action|Description|
|---|---|
|HTTP + Swagger|Make an HTTP call and return the response content|

### Action details

The HTTP + Swagger connector comes with 1 possible action. Below, there is information on each of the actions, their required and optional input fields, and the corresponding output details associated with their usage.
